What is Open Source
-------------------- 
Git made by Linus Torvald of Linux fame 
Understanding and internalizing Git is key to understand Coding. 
Version Control and collaborative working is possible. 
Automation in Merge Checkin of Code 
Pull Requests and how to add code make change in code and submit for review. 
You code Not only for yourself but for everybody else and perhaps millions of time per second. 

Decisions made 
--------------
I will be curating the videos that they need to see and develop their undersatnding over time. 
my Choice is to use 
1. Udemy Python course Automate the boring stuff with python
2. Charles Severance lectures
3. Code with Harry notes and Youtube

If time permits we will try to include 
a primer for various avenues that are available after this basic Python course.
